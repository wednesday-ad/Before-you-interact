Hello, I'm Wednesday, a subsystem in a C-DID system. (Despite being a system I use singular terms for my subsystem.) I'm socially withdrawn, emotionally avoidant, and struggle with empathy; but I will not intentionally hurt you. I'm autistic, not cruel. **I will not initiate conversations**, but I have no problem responding to them. Do not expect me to reach out daily, I will not. I am known to speak in a pessimistic light, but I will not bring you down if you are an optimist. **I do not vent to others**, but I may info-dump if I am comfortable, sometimes this will include negative topics. **Do not vent to me,** I severely lack empathy and will most likely unintentionally bring you down further. **Do not flirt with me**, the system has a partner, and I have a girlfriend. Even if I was single and interested in you, I do not engage in such affections. I speak both literally and use a lot of figurate language, if you do not understand something I've said--do not hesitate to ask. I take things very literally despite my word choice, if I misunderstand you please correct me. I am a quiet borderline with paranoid and dependent traits, this makes my relationships with others unstable. I hold myself to a standard; and **will never take my splits out on you**, give me space when I request and we will never have an issue. If I hurt you, despite my lack of empathy I will apologize as it is the respectful thing to do, if you hurt me I am likely to distance myself. I am still working on communication, as I stil live with our abusers, but treat me like a person and I promise to be loyal. **If you can not handle someone with autism and BPD do not befriend me or my headmates.**
