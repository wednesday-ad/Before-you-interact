☆˚ Introduction.

Hello, I'm Wednesday, a subsystem in a C-DID system. (Despite being a system I use singular terms for my subsystem.) I am a sysmed, anti-transmed, and believe pronouns do not equate to gender.


☆˚ Prerequisite.

I'm socially withdrawn, emotionally avoidant, and struggle with empathy; but I will not intentionally hurt you. I'm autistic, not cruel. **I will not initiate conversations**, but I have no problem responding to them. Do not expect me to reach out daily, I will not. I am known to speak in a pessimistic light, but I will not bring you down if you are an optimist. **I do not vent to others**, but I may info-dump if I am comfortable, sometimes this will include negative topics. I talk gramatically correctly, that doesn't mean I don't have a sense of humor, I just prefer to speak this way. I  speak both literally and use a lot of figurate language, if you do not understand something I've said--do not hesitate to ask. I take things very literally despite my word choice, if I misunderstand you please correct me. I am a quiet borderline with paranoid and dependent traits, this makes my relationships with others unstable. **I hold myself to a standard; and will never take my splits out on you**, give me space when I request and we will never have an issue. If I hurt you, despite my lack of empathy, I will apologize; as it is the respectful thing to do. **If you need something from me request it**, I will not read your subtext due to our BPD. (Reading into subtext can make us delusional, triggering our paranoia.) You can make jokes about your trauma at will, but **do not make jokes about ours.** I do not experience any emotional empathy, but I am good with logical empathy, so you may not notice. If you hurt me I am likely to distance myself. I am still working on communication, as I still live with our abusers, but treat me like a person and I promise to be loyal. **If you can not handle someone with autism and BPD do not befriend me or my headmates.** We are diagnosed with many mental health conditons, but we only share are Autism, DID, and BPD publicly; because of how it will affect our relationships with others. Do not inquire on our daignoses or lack their of, because I am not interested in sharing. I prefer to experience real life rather than be online, but we are currently unable to attend in-person school, therefore we are online frequently due to social deprivation. I do not engage in social media unless I am in desperate need of an escape from my home. 



☆˚ Boundaries.

Treat me as a fictionkin, I am not a delusion-holding alter. **Do not vent to me,** I severely lack empathy and will most likely unintentionally bring you down further. Reframe from speaking about suicide, substance abuse, and self-harm around me; again--I don't have emotional empathy and logical empathy is not enough for a conversation that serious. I will talk you out of suicide, but if you continue to press for extended periods of time, I will most likely become agitated; this is a trauma response and can not be controlled. **Do not bring up RAMCOA**, I will not be explaining further but note this makes me uncomfortable. **Do not flirt with me**, the system has a partner, and I have a girlfriend. Even if I was single and interested in you, I do not engage in such affections. **Do not lump me into the "good borderlines"**. I am antisocial, impulsive, avoidant, and I lack empathy, so I display the traits that you find "morally wrong"--and grouping people with Borderline Personality Disorder into "good" and "bad" categories based on symptoms is ableist. Along with this, any hate for people with ASPD, NPD, PPD, HC-DID, HPD, AVPD, Bipolar, Schizophrenia, or Schizoaffective will not be tolerated.


☆˚ Interests. 

I am interested in a lot of aspects of psychology, it is a collective special interest of ours, and it will most likely be brought up if you speak with me frequently. Layla, our co-host, enjoys playing *99 Nights in the Forest.* I enjoy tweening, Layla enjoys editing, so we frequently send edits to close friends as an autistic love language. My most prominent hobbies are research and writing, my favorite pass-times.
