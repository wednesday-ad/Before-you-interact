Hello, I'm Wednesday, an alter in a DID system. (Collective account @blackpawz) I am a system myself (subsystem.) I'm socially withdrawn, emotionally avoidant, and struggle with empathy; but I will not intentionally hurt you. I'm autistic, I'm not a monster. **I will not initiate conversations**, but I have no problem responding to them. Do not expect me to reach out daily, I will not. I am known to speak in a negative light, as I am pessimistic, but that is just wording and does not reflect my mood. (For reference I often use, "It wasn't horrible," over, "It was good.") I will not vent, but I may info-dump, sometimes about negative topics. If you vent to me I will attempt comfort out of respect, but I can not promise I will be of any use. **Do not flirt with me**, the system has a partner, and I have a girlfriend. Even if I was single, I do not engage in such affections.
